<h1>Happy Birthday!</h1>
<p>I knew you could do it. Be kind to yourself & be around good company. Drink something good and listen to the right music.</p>

<p>Some stories:</p>
<p>Another Spiderman game came out and it included Brooklyn this time. Grand Army, Prospect Park, and the path to your apartment are so abridged and distorted (for gameplay reasons) that it feels like an uncanny dream. The library is the funniest part because of its relation to everything else.</p>
<p>I'm going to be getting away from Denver today, hopefully, with Camille before she's out of state with her friends. I think you'd like the Chautauqua trails in the spring if you don't mind the bus rides.</p>
<p>I somehow lost another spork within my apartment. I hope I'm not somehow throwing them away, due to their lightness....</p>

<p>(I'm going to practice my wording in writing when I can, and send emails about pressing matters and breaking news.)</p>
