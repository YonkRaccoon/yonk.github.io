      <p>And so, we return to writing.</p>

    <p style="width:40%">Consistent opinions are what make me love something. Be it a person or a creation on this planet, we are consisted of behaviors-- actions which are guided by some cosmic force of preference. Sometimes, I call these "opinions." Like all of us creatures, I would honestly take unprecendented comfort in being loved, and being wanted. Not out of fear of power, eccentric fascination, or habitual need to protect.
	
	And, recently, I've been surrounded by the writings, drawings, and video recordings of those who I love from a distance. Analysts more than critics; artists more than journalists. It reminds me to get going-- to put my feelings and knowledge out there in the public moreso than the month before, before I eventually forget what I care about and become content to wait around for nothing. I think about these video essays and comedy comics. I imagine where my favorite writers had to begin from, and I decide, again, older still, to write again.</p>
    <br>
    
    <p style="width:40%">Motives are what make me love something. Be it a person or a creation on this planet, we are consisted of motives-- actions which are guided by some cosmic form of opinion. Sometimes, I think about "guidance--" what I want to navigate someone else to, and for what effect. I hope that, in regards to guiding the viewer, the gap between my drawing and writing close. I want the viewer to really be a visitor or a resident of the places I build. When someone takes the effort to travel, they should be fed well so their entirety can thrive.</p>
    <br>
  
  <p style="width:40%">Writing is one of the unique, powerful magics, for those with vision intact, to translate and absorb. Which is an unnecessarily fantastical way to say that writing is strong, yet limited. And I can choose to write it that way, with no immediate need to think about my vocal inflection or speed of talking. The written word is also dettached from other vision (the body, the face, the origin of oneself) and conceals the writer in a mysterious cloak. All that remains is what the reader can take away from the wording. It is the reader who decides how malicious or magnificent the writer is.... <i>I ABSOLUTELY hate you.</i> What do you think? Was that genuine? Was it entertaining? Well, we both made it to the end of this paragraph; maybe, we're both incredibly intelligent and attractive people.</p>
