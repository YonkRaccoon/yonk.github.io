(1) illustration page/papers in an exhibit:
	a cloud or grid of (draggable) thumbnails that take you to a color-coded gallery of the picture, with a mood-setting song track that unmutes while present? (malicious, 	naughty, goofy, pleasant, organic, sad)
 	refer to max collins' and r3drunn3r's sites.
	extra: being taken to a mood gallery lets you move left/right to view every other piece in that category (same song, same walls)

(2) bio/manifesto/beliefs - my own voice, podcast, radio:
	a commentary section where there's multiple panes of text, some with an audio player which has me narrating the tone needed to convey the proper emotions, set to neutral 	music.

(3) journals page:
