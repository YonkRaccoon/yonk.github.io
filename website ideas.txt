	artistic vision: an homage to point and click adventure and interactive sites of the early 2000s
	able to be improved after creation
	a single-view mural/photo collage where you can navigate to what you're curious about from the 	home page.
	No minimalistic branding or similarly-colored icons. The main links need to feel like their own 	brands.

**navigation menu needs to be a width and height that adapts to phone and PC without leaving the margins or messing up the imagemap**

links page: a collection of links I would direct people to if they no longer had a search engine. education, cooking, artists

(1) illustration page/papers in an exhibit:
	a cloud or grid of (draggable) thumbnails that take you to a color-coded gallery of the picture, with a mood-setting song track that unmutes while present? (malicious, 	naughty, goofy, pleasant, organic, sad)
 	refer to max collins' and r3drunn3r's sites.
	extra: being taken to a mood gallery lets you move left/right to view every other piece in that category (same song, same walls)

(2) bio/manifesto/beliefs - my own voice, podcast, radio:
	a commentary section where there's multiple panes of text, some with an audio player which has me narrating the tone needed to convey the proper emotions, set to neutral 	music.

(3) journals page:

(4) porn page:
	has a warning page first with a manifesto disclaimer
	Has a intuitive way to avoid elements like incest, degredation, and age difference
	
	link section for e621 favorites & artists I believe in


(5) music page:
	audio player follows you. you choose out songs from simple visuals or decorative text.
